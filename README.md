# CS50P ‚Äì Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository for **CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python** ‚Äì a course offered by Harvard University through edX. This course is part of the broader CS50 family, focusing on the fundamentals of programming using the Python language.

## üß† What is CS50P?

CS50P is a beginner-friendly yet comprehensive introduction to programming concepts, designed for learners with little to no prior experience. The course covers essential topics that are foundational to programming and problem-solving.

## üìö What Does It Consist Of?

Throughout the course, students explore topics such as:

- Functions, Variables, and Conditionals  
- Loops and Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)  
- File I/O  
- Regular Expressions  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Unit Testing and Error Handling  
- Web Programming Basics  

The course includes interactive labs, problem sets, and a final project to apply the concepts learned.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About the Cheating Policy

Due to Harvard's **strict academic honesty policy**, I am **not allowed to share solutions to the official problem sets**. Sharing or publishing these solutions violates the course's honor code and can lead to disqualification or retroactive failure.

## üí° What‚Äôs Included in This Repository?

While you won‚Äôt find any direct solutions here, I‚Äôve included a few **original Python projects** I created along the way to reinforce my learning. These include small utilities, practice scripts, and experimental programs that demonstrate concepts covered in the course.
